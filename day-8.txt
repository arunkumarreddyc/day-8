QUESTION:  
1.Class - Movie
The class Movie is stated below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class has the following three properties:

title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)

a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.

CODE:
class movie {
      constructor(moviename="" , productions = "", rating = "") {
        this.moviename = moviename;
        this.productions = productions;
        this.rating = rating;
      }
     
    }
    
    let cinema = new movie("singam", "kk production", "PG");


QUESTION:1.b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.

CODE:
class movie {
      constructor(moviename="" , productions = "", rating = "PG") {
        this.moviename = moviename;
        this.productions = productions;
        this.rating = rating;
      }
     
    }
    
    let cinema = new movie("singam", "kk production", "");



QUESTION: 1.c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full.

CODE:
class movie {
  constructor(moviename="" , productions = "", rating = "") {
    this.moviename = moviename;
    this.productions = productions;
    this.rating = rating;
  }
  static getPg(movies) {
    let pgrating = [];
    for (let ms of movies) {
      if (ms.rating == "PG") {
        pgrating.push(ms);
      }
    }
    return pgrating;
  }
}

let cinema = [
  new movie("singam", "kk production", "PG"),
  new movie("kick", "ll production", "PG"),
  new movie("kdk", "kjg prod", "R"),
  new movie("dgg", "ggg", "12"),
  new movie("djg", "dgg", "PG"),
];

console.log(movie.getPg(cinema));
OUTPUT:
[
  movie {
    moviename: 'singam',
    productions: 'kk production',
    rating: 'PG'
  },
  movie {
    moviename: 'kick',
    productions: 'll production',
    rating: 'PG'
  },
  movie { moviename: 'djg', productions: 'dgg', rating: 'PG' }
]

QUESTION:1.d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”

CODE:
class movie {
  constructor(moviename = "", productions = "", rating = "") {
    this.moviename = moviename;
    this.productions = productions;
    this.rating = rating;
  }
 getPg(movies) {
    
    return `${this.moviename}-${this.productions}-${this.rating}`;
  }
}

let cinema = new movie('Casino Royale','Eon Productions','PG-13');

console.log(cinema.getPg());


OUTPUT:
Casino Royale-Eon Productions-PG-13



QUESTION:  2.Create a class circle to get the double value of 'radius' and string of color 'red' and use getArr and setArr method to get the area,circumference and color of the circle.

CODE:
class circle {
setcircle(radius, color) {
    this.radius =parseFloat( radius );
    this.color = color;
  }

getcircleArea() {

    let area = (22/7)*(this.radius)**2
    return  area;

}

getcircleCircumference() {

    let circumference = 2*(22/7)*(this.radius)
    return  circumference;

}

getcircleColor() {

    let color = this.color
    return  color;

}
}

let circle1 = new circle();
circle1.setcircle('3.2', "red");
console.log(`Area of circle is : ${circle1.getcircleArea()}`);
console.log(`Circumference of circle is : ${circle1.getcircleCircumference()}`);
console.log(`Color of circle is : ${circle1.getcircleColor()}`);

OUTPUT:
Area of circle is : 32.182857142857145
Circumference of circle is : 20.114285714285714
Color of circle is : red


QUESTION:  3.Write a “person” class to hold all the details.

CODE:
class person {
  constructor(name, height, weight, color) {
    this.name = name;
    this.height = height;
    this.weight = weight;
    this.color = color;
  }
   get Details() {
    let detls = [
      `Name:${this.name},height:${this.height},weight: ${this.weight},color: ${this.color} `,
    ];
    return detls;
  }
}

let person1 = new person("arun", "5.8", "63", "fair");
console.log(person1.Details);

OUTPUT:
[ 'Name:arun,height:5.8,weight: 63,color: fair ' ]


QUESTION:  4.write a class to calculate uber price.

CODE:

class uberprice {
    constructor(timeofRide,km,chargePerMinute ) {
      this.timeofRide = timeofRide;
      this.km = km;
      this.chargePerMinute = chargePerMinute;
    }
    // Getter
    get price() {
      return this.calculatedPrice();
    }
    // Method
    calculatedPrice() {

      return (this.chargePerMinute)+(this.timeofRide*this.km)
  }
}

  const uberride = new uberprice(30,10,11);

  console.log(`Your uber ride price is Rs.${uberride.price}`);
OUTPUT:
Your uber ride price is Rs.311
